    repository published by demokane.

- main.ipynb: Notebook contains most of our results.

- RPI SF.ipynb: Notebook contains the computation of our seasonality factor, which is thereafter directly used in main.ipynb.

- sub.ipynb: Notebook contains the plot for 
    "Seasonally adjusted vs not, $B_0$=2015-01, interplation: flat"
    figure in our report

- plots: Folder contains most of the figures we included in our report. Some plots in these folders may have not been used.
